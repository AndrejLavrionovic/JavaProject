The ADFGVX cypher was used by the Germans Army in WW1 from March 1918
to encrypt field communications during the Ludendorff Offensive
(Keiserschlacht). The cypher is si named because all messages are encrypted
into codes from the small alphabet of ADFGVX to reduce operator error when
sending Morse Code signals. Although an improvement on the ADFGVX cypher
used by the Germans up until 1918, the new cypher was broken by the
French cryptanalyst Georges Painvin and proved decisive in repulsing
the attack at Compiegne on June 11th 1918.
